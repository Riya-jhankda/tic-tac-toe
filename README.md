## What We are building?

We will be implementing our Python knowledge learned so far from the scaler module link to Python module, to build, the project called the tic tac toe Python. Here we will be dividing the tic tac toe Python project into various steps to ease the understanding while parallelly building the game.

Tic tac toe Python, also known as Noughts and Crosses or Xs and Os, is a very simple two-player game where both the player get to choose any of the symbols between X and O. This game is played on a 3X3 grid board and one by one each player gets a chance to mark its respective symbol on the empty spaces of the grid. Once a player is successful in marking a strike of the same symbol either in the horizontal, vertical or diagonal way as shown in the picture below is created that player wins the game else the game goes on a draw if all the spots are filled.
